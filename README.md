# kmd-gpu-mining

**To mine Komodo with GPU, you will need 3 things:**

1. Komodod  
2. kmd-nomp   
3. zcash miner of your choice 

*Please note, komodod and kmd-nomp are only required because there are currently no KMD mining pools.* 
*We will basically be setting up a local mining pool, as its required for GPU support*

**A guide detailing installation of Komodod and KMD-nomp can be found here:**

**Once Komodod and KMD-Nomp are running, you now have a stratum pool to point your GPU miners.**
